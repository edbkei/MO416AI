    "# 2. Problem\n",
    "# Pac-man is one of the most popular Arcade games, still played nowadays. In the game, there is a maze where Pac-man\n",
    "# has to act to collect as many pieces as possible without being caught by one of the ghosts. The maze is defined in\n",
    "# terms of a grid, as presented in Figure 1. The black areas are non-traversable walls, the grey path represents elements\n",
    "# that should be caught by the agent, and the white areas are traversable areas. Your group should define additional\n",
    "# elements, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "# [R10] The size and shape of the maze\n",
    "# [R11] A final goal position\n",
    "# [R12] The static positions of 3 Ghosts in the scene (the positions do not change during the game)\n",
    "# [R13] Pac-man's initial position\n",
    "\n",
    "# To solve the problem, you have to specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "# [R14] The state representation\n",
    "# [R15] The set of actions\n",
    "# [R16] The objective state test\n",

    "# [R18] The heuristics used\n",
    "\n",
    "# The system must be evaluated according to the quality of the solutions found and a critical evaluation is expected on\n",
    "# the relationship between adopted parameters x solution performance. Graphs and tables representing the evolution of\n",
    "# the solutions are expected. Additional comparisons with the literature are welcome, although they are not mandatory.\n",
    "# To evaluate the results you might change the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "# [R19] Pac-man's initial position\n",
    "# [R20] Goal position\n",
    "# [R21] State discretization (maze size and configuration)\n",
    "# [R22] Ghosts' position\n",
    "\n",
    "# [R23] It is important to remember that we will not perform an online search. As the problem is completely observable and\n",
